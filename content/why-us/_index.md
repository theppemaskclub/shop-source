At the PPE Mask Club, weâ€™ve been closely monitoring the coronavirus situation, as we take very seriously our responsibility to protect our employees, our customers, their families and the communities we serve.

As the owner and president of The PPE Mask Club, I insist on nothing but the best from our suppliers, salesforce and staff.

I am fully involved in every operation and decision and my promise to you is we will truly listen to your concerns to customize our products and services for your specific needs and wants. We will always treat you with respect, you will never be just a number to us. We are here because of you.
